===================

Chosen to just use Bootstrap for now.

We will need End to End tests so perhaps we can use Mocka for those.

Testing Note: a project checked into source control and later checked out, needs to have bower install run from the test folder as well as from project root.

### Developing ###

Run <code>grunt serve</code> to view your app.

### Testing ###

Run
<code>grunt test</code>
To run the test suite.

### Deploying ###

Within the dist folder are files for deployment, before deployment.
<code>grunt</code>

must be run to prepare this dist folder.
